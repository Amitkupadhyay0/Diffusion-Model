**Classification Models vs Generative Models**

---

Suppose you want to build a model that can label an image—like predicting "Car" when given a car image. For this task, we have various methods, ranging from traditional classification models like logistic regression to more advanced ones like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

But what if, instead of just labeling an image, you wanted your model to generate entirely new images—images that have never been seen before, but are learned from existing data? That’s where generative models come into play.
